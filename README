metric visualization

currently uses spherical metric and displays basis along theta and phi

soon to display additional information such as 
	connection coefficients visually as changes in basis along coordinates in terms of basis vectors
	integrating along derivatives vs integrating along geodesics
	maybe something to do with riemann metric tensor and geodesic deviation
	more fomulas
	custom formulas - either by rewriting my CAS in javascript (or using a pre-existing one) 
		... or send the formula to the server for lua to run it against my own lua CAS here: https://github.com/thenumbernine/symmath-lua
		... or emulate that lua CAS in javascript using Emscripten
